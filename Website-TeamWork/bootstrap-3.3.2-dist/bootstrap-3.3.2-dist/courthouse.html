  	 <h2>The Main Guard</h2>
<p>
As its name suggests, it was here that the main guard of the town troops for Clonmel were once stationed. During the siege of Clonmel in 1650 the old Manor Court was destroyed, and after the restoration of the Duke of Ormond's palatinate rights in 1662 he ordered the building of a new courthouse. It was completed in 1674. The rumour abounds that Christopher Wren designed the Main Guard, but no evidence exists to support this claim. The building's most striking features are its five semi-circular arches and a handsome clock and bell tower. On the west wall can be seen two coats of arms: those of the Borough of Clonmel and those of the Ormond family, both bearing the date 1675. In recent years the Main Guard has undergone substantial renovation by the Office of Public Works, who have brought the building back to its original 17th Century design. The Main Guard is open to visitors from March to late October.

  	 <h2>Old St. Maryâ€™s Church</h2>
<p>
Old St. Mary's Church is believed to be the oldest church in Clonmel, County Tipperary, Ireland. It is believed to have been built in 1204 by William de Burgh. It was the first building ever to be referenced in the town, appearing in a letter dated August 1228. The entire over ground 13th Century structure has disappeared, but the remains of an armoured knight were found in a vault from that period, under the south aisle, in 1832. The Church as it is known today took shape during the 14th, 15th and 16th Centuries. Cromwell's attack on the town cost the Church its Tower House (today's vestry), the rest of the church was unscathed. The Church's main features are a 27 ft square, 84 ft high bell tower, the eastern tower house, and ornate 16th Century east and west windows. Major renovations were undertaken on the building in 1805. The Tower had, at one time, a wooden spire and belfry, which has not been restored.

  	 <h2>The West Gate</h2>
<p>
Guarding the western entrance to the town, at the end of O'Connell St., is the impressive West Gate. The current structure dates from 1831, having been built by a merchant called Joyce. The original building that stood before then was erected for defensive purposes, in order to keep the Norman town safe from the invasion of the Irish. The natives lived beyond the town's walls, and today the area of the town west of the Gate is known as "Irishtown". Despite the fact that they were not permitted to live within the town's walls, the Irish were, however, allowed into the Clonmel to trade at fairs and markets. During the course of the last century the Gate fell into disrepair, prompting concerned locals to organise its restoration. It was re-roofed, the arches were re-enforced with steel beams and the floors were stabilised, also using steel. The east face of the gate carries a limestone plaque commemorating Clonmel born author Lawrence Stern, sculpted by Frances Dietrich in 1975.

  	 <h2>The Jail Gate </h2>
<p>
St. Patrick's Borstal Institution, Clonmel was established in 1906 as a place of detention for young male offenders aged between 16 and 21. For a brief period during the Irish Civil War, the prisoners were transferred to the Workhouse at Clogheen, while the Borstal buildings at Clonmel were occupied by Irish Free State military forces. The inmates at Clogheen Workhouse were in turn transferred to other Unions. One week later, 17 of the boys escaped and on the night of 4 November, the town was suddenly abandoned by the Free State forces and occupied the following day by Republicans. Four days later, the Republicans gave notice that the facility was to be vacated immediately as they intended to set it on fire. The 81 inmates and the staff were hurriedly moved to the sanctuary of the nearby Fever Hospital. Petrol was used to ensure that the main buildings were totally destroyed despite the torrential rain. Father Nicholas Sheehy was an 18th-century Irish Roman Catholic priest who was executed on charge of accessory to murder. Father Sheehy was hanged, drawn and quartered at Clonmel on 15 March 1766. His head was severed and stuck on a spike over Clonmel Gaol as a warning against agrarian violence. His head remained above the porch at Clonmel jail for twenty years.	</p>

  	 <h2>Hearn's Hotel</h2>
<p>
The date, 1792, seen on the cut stone archway may be the date of the building or more likely the date of the courtyard where Charles Bianconi established his coaching enterprise. Bianconi, a 16 year old Italian, was sent to Ireland to avoid a scandal as he was considered too friendly with a local girl who was betrothed to a nobleman since her childhood. In 1815, he started a one horse cart transport system between Clonmel and Cahir. By 1825, his carriages were covering 1870 miles a day and by 1857, 4244 miles a day in 22 counties. His headquarters were in Hearns and he lived there himself from 1826 to 1834 when he handed the building over to his friend and assistant, Daniel Hearn, who converted it into a hotel.  Bianconi became a friend of the great Daniel Oâ€™Connell. He contributed greatly to the funds of the struggle for Catholic Emancipation and became the third Catholic mayor of Clonmel. The Entrance to Hearnâ€™s Hotel was reconstructed in 1974 and again in 1992 and the interior was extensively redecorated.  Bianconi was twice Mayor of Clonmel and was a strict but fair employer
